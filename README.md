## What it does

AI Engineer Coach reads your local AI session logs and turns them into actionable insights — no data leaves your machine.

- **Track progress** -- practice scores, weekly trends, daily activity charts
- **Detect anti-patterns** -- 45 rules across prompt quality, session hygiene, code review, tool mastery, and context management
- **Measure output** -- AI-generated code volume by language, workspace, model, and harness
- **Discover skills** -- find repeated prompts and turn them into reusable skills
- **Score context health** — agentic readiness checks, instruction-file audits, workspace context maps

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/ai-engineering-coach.git
cd ai-engineering-coach
npm install
npm run package
```

Then install the `.vsix`:

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
code --install-extension ai-engineer-coach-*.vsix
```

**Windows / PowerShell**

```powershell
code --install-extension (Get-ChildItem . -Filter 'ai-engineer-coach-*.vsix' | Select-Object -First 1).FullName
```

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run **AI Engineer Coach: Open Dashboard**
3. Navigate pages from the sidebar, filter by workspace or harness

## Privacy

- **Read-only** — the extension never modifies your session files
- **Local analysis** — all parsing and analytics run entirely on your machine
- **No proprietary telemetry** — the extension does not phone home or collect usage data
- **Optional AI features** — some features (rule compiler, skill finder, context review) use the VS Code built-in Copilot language model API when explicitly invoked by the user
